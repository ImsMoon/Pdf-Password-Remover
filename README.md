## üìÑ About The Project

This project provides a simple and secure web application to unlock password-protected PDF files. If you have a PDF that requires a password to open, you can upload it here, provide the password, and download a new, unprotected version of the file.

The entire process is designed to be quick and intuitive. This tool is perfect for users who need to remove security from their PDFs for easier access, printing, or archiving.

This application was developed with the assistance of **Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro**, leveraging its capabilities for code generation, logic structuring, and content creation.
